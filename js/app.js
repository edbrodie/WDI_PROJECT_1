//Pseudocode: All pseudocode will be written in this JS file prior to MVP developemnt.


    '->' signifys pseudocode for HTML

    '**' signifys pseudocode for CSS

    '~' signifys pseudocode for JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY


//pseudocode as follows (work in progress..)




-> Setup link in the HTML for Jquery library

->Create the HTML structure to allow CSS & DOM manipulation for a grid layout (4x4)
  -> a class assigned for row1, row2, row3, ro4
  -> a class assigned for col1, col2, col3, col4
  -> an ID for each indiviual grid item (12 total)
  -> input ID names into each grid element for visual identification on page load

** Apply generic colour scheme to background, grid and grid items
** Establish alignment, padding and margin to have the page present symetrically and ready for initial js/jquery/dom manipulation.
** CSS to be left at this point until MVP is established.

~ Setup and test listener to check for DOM load

~ setup global variables and tie them to their HTML counterparts

~ setup code to have all 12 grid items to 'show' on page load as default

~ wait 10 seconds before hiding each grid item
